# Weather Forecasting Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing weather data to forecast future conditions using data science and machine learning techniques. The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository explores historical weather data, applies statistical and predictive modeling, and visualizes key insights.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-series analysis for trend identification
- Machine learning models for weather prediction
- Visualization of key weather patterns

## Dataset
The project utilizes historical weather data, which includes parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. Ensure that the dataset is available in the appropriate format before running the analysis.

## Installation & Requirements
To run this project, you need Python and the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Additionally, Jupyter Notebook is required to execute the `.ipynb` file:
```bash
pip install notebook

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChandraMoon88/weather-forecasting-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd weather-forecasting-analysis
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the `weather-forecasting-analysis.ipynb` notebook step by step.

## Results
The project provides:
- Data-driven insights on weather patterns.
- Predictive models for forecasting weather conditions.
- Graphical representations of trends and relationships in weather data.
